            At One Heart McKinney, we believe hearing feedback from every corner of our WHOLE community makes us stronger. The first convening of the OHM Advisory Council took place on Friday, August 19th with representatives from McKinney’s nonprofits, businesses, churches, school district, emergency services, government, and media in attendance. The purpose of the Advisory Council is to ensure OHM keeps our finger on the pulse of the city, so that we may stay ahead of the next crisis and respond quickly and efficiently. Housing was immediately identified as the current greatest need and much brainstorming took place amongst Advisory Council members to determine how we may respond together to help our citizens in need.

          McKinney community leaders including Mayor George Fuller, MISD Superintendent Dr. Rick McDaniel, McKinney Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Lisa Hermes, Wells Group founder Rick Wells, and others are excited to announce the official formation of a new community collaboration called One Heart McKinney (OHM).  Since the beginning of the pandemic, the group raised and distributed almost $200k in grants to support this mission.
          The OHM effort will focus on five core needs to maximize well-being in daily life, including food and hygiene; health, including physical, mental, and spiritual; housing; economic stability; and education. These five core needs were initially identified in a 2019 study performed by The Institute for Urban Policy Research at the University of Texas at Dallas, funded by the McKinney Alliance.
          The McKinney community currently has many resources in place to address these five core needs, but there is significant opportunity for us to better coordinate our efforts to maximize the impact of these resources on the community well-being. This is objective of OHM.

          The informal One Heart McKinney collaboration initially formed in March 2020 as a response to the early COVID crisis, when leaders from across McKinney came together on a weekly basis to assess current needs and rally resources to address them. 
          The initial group of leaders included representatives from McKinney city government, businesses, MISD, first responders and law enforcement, nonprofits, and faith communities. Based on the trust that was built through this collaborative experience, the group decided to continue working together in a more formalized manner to coordinate those seeking to address on-going community needs, as well as to remain mobilized for future crises that occur.
          “For the first time, the entire community collaborated in a unique way that sets us up for success in addressing our 5 core needs of food, health, housing, education and jobs,” continued Hermes.  “From the relational equity forged through the COVID crisis, One Heart McKinney has come together to unite everyone who wants to work in collaboration to build a flourishing community that benefits all of us.”
