# 1-heart-referrals
# Referral System: 
 This project will enable One Heart McKinney Navigators  to make effective and efficient referrals to social service providers for families in need.  System needs include storing information about network partners, allow for ‘intake’ (capturing family information and needs), creation and tracking of referrals from One Heart McKinney to network partners, and provide for referral follow-up, tracking and reporting.

# Goal: 
Provide database design and the ability to capture partner and client data. This will lay the foundation for the ability to create the referral entry, tracking, follow-and reporting capabilities.
